# LineWriter

LineWriter is a very small text editing script I designed for use with a 16x2
lcd character display. The display is intoned to be connected over GPIO pins
using i2c.

## Features

- Automatic file names depending on the current date and time
- Scrolling text
- Exit by writing `EXIT` on an empty line
- Save lines to file by pressing return
